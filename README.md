Recipe Page - Practice Project

This is a simple practice project where I’ve created a recipe page to experiment with HTML, and CSS.

What’s Inside
- Basic Recipe Layout: A simple design to showcase recipes with ingredients, instructions, and images.
- Styling: Uses custom CSS for layout and basic styling.

How to View
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to check out the recipe page.

Purpose
This is just a fun practice project to work on front-end web development. It's not intended to be a fully functional or polished website—just a chance to experiment and learn!

Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Notes
- The design and content are simple and subject to change as I improve my skills.
- Contributions, suggestions, or feedback are always welcome!
